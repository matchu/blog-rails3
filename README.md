# Matchusian Bloggage

Just a very simple blog with very, very simple admin controls (read: hardcoded)
to test out how Rails 3 works.

## Features:

* Your everyday blog-type stuff
* Basic admin authentication (very, very basic)
* Absolutely nothing else right now

It uses [HAML][h] for templating. I like [HAML][h].
